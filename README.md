# Air-Quality-Classification-System-using-Random-Forest-Algorithm-using-IoT-based-MQ7-and-MQ13-Sensor
This project aims to create a system that can detect air quality index using MQ-7 and MQ-135 sensors with Random Forest algorithm to classify the results into three types of classes "Good", "Bad", or "Toxic" that can be accessed on a PC monitor in real time.
